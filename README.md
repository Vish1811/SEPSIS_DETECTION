# Overview
1. The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. 
2. Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before itâ€™s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. 
3. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. 
4. Educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. 
5. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines
